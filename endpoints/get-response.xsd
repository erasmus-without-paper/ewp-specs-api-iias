                                        A list of HEIs participating in this IIA.

                                        This list includes the local HEI which MUST be the first element on this list.
                                        In other words:

                                        * The value of `hei-id` of the first `partner` MUST match the HEI id covered
                                          by the host,

                                        * Both `iia-id` and `iia-code` elements MUST be present in the first `partner`
                                          element (even though it's not required by the schema itself), and one of them
                                          MUST match one of the values passed in the `iia_id` or `iia_code` request
                                          parameter.

                                        * The server will usually fill much more data for the first `partner`.

                                                    Optional organizational unit surrogate ID. If given, then it refers to the unit
                                                    within the partner HEI's organizational structure, which is the actual partner
                                                    of this agreement. Agreements can be signed between units, not only between
                                                    HEIs: https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-specs-api-iias/issues/11

                                                    If provided, then it MUST have the value of the "official" ounit-id, exactly as
                                                    it has been assigned by the *partner HEI* in its Organizational Units API. If
                                                    this official ID is not known by the server (and it often isn't), then this
                                                    element MUST be skipped. This is a surrogate ID, so it SHOULD NOT be displayed
                                                    to the user (use `ounit-code` for that).

                                                    The partner's unique surrogate ID of this IIA. This is a surrogate ID, so it
                                                    SHOULD NOT be displayed to the user (use `iia-code` for that).

                                                    Since IIA IDs are local (unique within a single HEI, but not within the world),
                                                    each partner is allowed to have his own ID for the same IIA.

                                                    ID used by the partner MUST be provided as soon as it is mapped in the local system.
                                                    Otherwise, an agreement might be interpreted as not mapped, which may lead to duplicates.
                                                    Also, it is REQUIRED to provide partner agreement ID to be able to approve it.
                                                    Yet, this ID MUST NOT be present if the partner has deleted the IIA.

                                                    Server implementers MUST use immutable surrogate keys for their work with EWP.

                                                    The partner's "human readable" ID of this IIA (aka an agreement number). If
                                                    this server is aware of the agreement numbers used by the other partners, then
                                                    it SHOULD output it here.

                                                    Since `iia-id` values should contain surrogate identifiers (and, as such,
                                                    should not be displayed to the user), we require additional "human readable"
                                                    agreement codes/numbers to be provided here. These codes SHOULD be displayed to
                                                    the user, and they MAY be used for searching, but they are *not used* to
                                                    directly identify entities in EWP network.

                                                    Only some servers provide these, even for the *local* partner. Many HEIs
                                                    (especially the smaller ones) don't granulate their contacts in such a detailed

                                                    API.

                                                    These contacts take precedence over contacts defined in the Institutions API
                                                    and Organization Units API for the partner HEI/unit. Clients are advised to
                                                    display these contacts in a separate section above other contacts - so that the

    <xs:complexType name="MobilitySpecification" abstract="true">
        <xs:annotation>
            <xs:documentation>
                A common parent class for all mobility specifications.

                Note that "mobility specification" is a name we (EWP designers) made up. We
                needed to have a descriptive name for this particular entity, and we couldn't
                find such name in existing Erasmus+ templates. In other words, this is an
                EWP-specific term only, and you should probably avoid using it in other
                contexts.

                Mobility specification may also be considered as a subclass of "cooperation
                condition", but - since currently all nonabstract subclasses inherit from
                MobilitySpecification - no CooperationCondition class is introduced. See here:
                https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-wp3-data-model/issues/10

                Each specification has a sending and receiving partner. Each specification
                represents an agreement that, for each of the academic years listed within, the
                sending partner will send a particular number of people to the receiving
                partner, for a particular average duration each (e.g. for 8 weeks). This
                describes an unidirectional flow - if people are sent in both directions, two
                separate mobility specifications need to be defined (one for each direction).

                More requirements (e.g. *who* is being sent to do *what*) are defined in
                specific `*-mobility-spec` subclasses.

                This type, nor any of its subclasses, SHOULD NOT be referenced outside of the
                EWP IIAs API. It is likely to be modified, or to be removed, in the future.

                        This data might be relevant for some partners, while other partners might
                        ignore it completely. If the server is aware that particular students should
                        come from a particular organizational unit, then it reports it here. Note, that
                        this MAY be the "root" unit (the one representing the entire HEI).

                        This ID is defined by the HEI referred to in the `sending-hei-id` element.
                        If the server is not aware of this ID, then it won't provide it. Clients
                        can retrieve further information on this unit via Organizational Units API, but
                        note, that it is not obvious *which* Organizational Units API the client should

                        Not all servers provide these! Many HEIs (especially the smaller ones) don't
                        granulate their contacts in such a detailed way. Instead, they have a fixed set
                        of contacts described in their Institutions API.

                        These contacts take precedence over contacts defined in the Institutions API,
                        and the ones defined in the `contact` elements of *this* API (outside of the
                        cooperation conditions list). Clients are advised to display these contacts in
                        a separate section above other contacts - so that the users will notice them
                        first (before scrolling down to other, more generic contacts).

                        ISCED-F subject area code.

                        ISCED-F codes define fields of education and training at the secondary,
                        post-secondary and tertiary levels of education. Details:
                        https://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/isced-fields-of-education-and-training-2013-en.pdf

                        Note: ISCED code MUST be four-digit,
                        to be compliant with the requirements of the Beneficiary module,
                        which only accepts four-digit codes for mobilities (see issue: #49).

                        Agreements mutually approved before IIA version 7 that had ISCED code with less then four digits
                        MUST have ISCED code replaced with a proper four digit ISCED code and
                        MUST have `v6-value` attribute set to the previous ISCED code approved in version 6.
                        After IIA version 7 is implemented and the agreement is modified the ISCED code
                        MUST be set by the end-user and the attribute MUST be removed.
