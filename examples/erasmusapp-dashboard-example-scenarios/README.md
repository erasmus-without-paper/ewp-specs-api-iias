# ErasmusAPP - Dashboard Use Cases and Scenarios
The goal of this PDF file is to efficiently describe the Use Cases and define Scenarios that detail the interactions between the Sending HEI and the Receiving HEI, under the assumption that one them is being represented by the `Dashboard` (and its students submit their applications through the `Erasmus App`).

They are part of the *EDSSI Project - Activity 2.4* and have been developed by the _EDSSI AUTh team_ (edssi@it.auth.gr).

## Scenarios
4 scenarios are examined:
* Scenarios 1-2: assume that the Sending HEI is being represented by `ErasmusAPP-Dashboard`, and
* Scenarios 3-4: assume that the Receiving HEI is being represented by `ErasmusAPP-Dashboard`.

Briefly, these scenarios are:
* Scenarios 1 and 3: Receiving accepts Nomination
* Scenarios 2 and 4: Receiving rejects Nomination

Along with the PDF file, the 4 example XML files are provided in the /src/xml folder.
